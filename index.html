                        tell which is the correct one.

                    A lot of the time, Bloom Filters are paired up with other
                    data structures that handle the storage of the items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For example, they are useful when paired with data structures 
                    that exhibit worst-case performance
                    when searching for items that are not in the data-structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In a linked list, or unsorted large array, for example, you
                    get the worst possible case performance when you're searching
                    for an item that just isn't there. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The bloom filter can check, before you hit the data structure,
                    if the data is in there.

                    they are also very useful

                    example, when a network call needs to be made to a far
                    away database, a local bloom filter is a wonderfully 
                    fast way to know if you are wasting everybody's time with
                    a request for something that doesn't exist.

                    The most important one being that they're "collision resistant" - 
                    it's astronomically unlikely that you will be able to find
                    two different items that hash to the same value.

                    Well, most of them, really, but a perceptual hash, or
                    pHash, is designed specifically to cluster very similar
                    images together in the hash output.

                        <p>
                        For example, if it's the same image, but sized larger,
                        or skewed to the left, it should end up with a hash
                        location very close to or identical to the hash location
                        of the original image.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Of course, by nature, this hash function won't be 
                        distributed in the way that we would need for
                        an optimal general-purpose data structure
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It's the opposite of an 'avalanching' hash - small changes
                        in the input lead to almost no changes in the output.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        But we can abuse that property so that false positives are
                        unfairly clustered on images that look very similar to
                        our banned images.
                        Which would actually probably be a good thing.

                    means that two inputs are astronomically unlikely to
                    collide? Here is where that's super important.

                    So, we've stolen a whole database full of usernames
                    and hashed passwords, and we want to get at the raw
                    passwords so that we can try them out on banking sites
                    and such.

                    What we can do, is create a list of everything that we
                    think of as a possible password. An enormous, comprehensive
                    list.

                    Then, we use the same hash that the programmer used to
                    hash the original passwords, 
                    and we run that on every single item in our gigantic

                    Now we have a giant collection of hash-to-password pairs, 
                    which we can compare against the original data.

                    This table of precomputed password-to-hash pairs

                    The MD5 hash function is so common that Juuso Salonen 
                    (I hope I pronounced his name right) released a utility
                    called Bozocrack 
                    that works by taking a hashed password, 
                    searching for it on Google, 
                    and then MD5-hashing everything that comes back in the
                    google results until it finds a match.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It's not as comprehensive as a MD5 Rainbow Table, but
                    it still manages to be depressingly effective.

                    Part of the reason the Rainbow Table attack is so effective
                    is that, because every user's password has been hashed
                    with the same hash function, it's possible for us to
                    test passwords against the entire table. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While it is unlikely that we will ever crack all of the
                    passwords, we're able to suss out the users who have 
                    simple passwords very quickly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Just testing the whole database against the 1000 most
                    common passwords shouldn't take more than an hour, 
                    and will provide us with a wealth of potentially 
                    useful data.

                    So what we want to do is reduce the effectiveness
                    of this kind of attack, by using a different hash
                    function for every single person in the database.

                    That doesn't mean we need to enlist thousands
                    of different hash implementations -
                    what it <em>actually</em> means is that we want to use one
                    hash function that we seed with a different value
                    for each user in the table, before we hash the
                    password for that user.

                    It has to be a value that we have access to -

                    hash function every time we check the user's password.

                    <p>
                    It's quite common to use the username for this value.

                    Cryptographers recommend that you create a large block

                    And when I say basics I mean very most basics. 
                    This isn't exactly state of the art.
                    Unix's 'crypt' function first used salted hashes to 
                    protect against rainbow tables in 1976, 
                    a decade before I was born.

                    <p>
                    I've been using MD5 as my de-facto cryptographic 
                    hash example for this presentation, because it's
                    well-known, and well-understood, and it's been 
                    in use for a good long time.

                    <p>
                    Unfortunately, in that good long time, cracks have 
                    begun to show in this venerable hashing algorithm. 
                    Collisions have been forced. It is growing less and
                    less capable of standing up against modern hardware.

                    <p>
                    The biggest reason to avoid MD5 is simply that it is
                    too fast. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It's possible to MD5 hash millions of values per second.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This makes brute force attacks against MD5-hashed passwords
                    very easy.

                    This MD5-hashing python script I wrote runs, on a cheap
                    little virtual machine, one million MD5 hashes in 
                    1.5 seconds.

                    Now, BCrypt is designed to be slow. Using the default settings

                    <p>
                    This, combined with a salt for each individual user, means
                    that brute forcing passwords out of a database could take
                    days or months per user, rather than an hour or two for
                    the whole thing.

                    BCrypt also comes with a work variable that you can crank
                    up to make things even slower as hardware gets faster.
                    When I turn it up to 15, my million-hash script goes from
                    3.4 days to run, to 26 days to run.

                    One of the key rules of security is "don't roll your own".
                    Don't try to be clever and implement a solution that
                    seems like it should work - do a little bit of 
                    research on the problem space and use something
                    that is designed with your problem in mind.

                    <p>
                    So, for password security, you should use something
                    that's specifically designed for password security - 
                    like Bcrypt, or PBKDF2

                    cryptographically much more secure.

                    Well, there are two different possibilities, here.

                    <p>
                    Either we're trying this from a browser,
                    or we're not trying this from a browser.
                    </p>

                    Let's look at the problems of doing this
                    with browser code.
                    </p>

                    What are we trying to accomplish, here?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We don't want people who can inspect our
                    traffic to see a password.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    We don't want people who can inspect our
                    traffic to be able to act on behalf
                    of our users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So we send our users a bit of code that
                    will allow them to obscure their credentials
                    when they communicate with us. 
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section data-background="images/175.gif">
                    <p>
                    Except if people can inspect our traffic, 
                    they can also alter our traffic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Which means they can replace our crypto code
                    with equivalent code that steals credentials.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    Javascript browser crypto is exactly as
                    secure as the transport layer providing it.

                    So Javascript browser crypto over HTTP
                    can't possibly be more secure than just
                    using HTTP - which is not secure at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And Javascript browser crypto over HTTPS is
                    as secure as just using TLS, 
                    which is ... more or less secure. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I trust that you can solve for the
                    value of Javascript Browser crypto in this equation.

                    Let's imagine, then, that we're not doing this 
                    from the browser, but from a trusted library 
                    that we have total control over, 
                    and we still want to keep them away from user data
                    and out of our application.

                    Well, if we just send a token containing a hash
                    of our password, all they have to do is steal that
                    token and they can start running Rainbow attacks on
                    it. Plus, with our token they can still pretend \
                    to be our user pretty effectively. That's bad.

                    <p> 
                    Should the server keep track of the timestamp?

                    <p>
                    Couldn't the attacker just steal our timestamped message
                    and replace the command with their own, malicious

                    This gets really complicated, really fast, and

                    <p>
                    We shouldn't be in the business of designing our

                    The hash function is a building block, but we

                    HMAC stands for 
                    "Hash-based Message Authentication Code",
                    and it's sort of what we're trying to 
                    generate, here.

                    A cryptographic hash function <em>can</em> be used to
                    generate a document signature, but some of the
                    common cryptographic hashes - MD5 and SHA, for 
                    example, have a property where,
                    once you have a signature for a secret+message combination,
                    it is trivially easy to generate secret+message+foo. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So if you send the message "Yo!"
                    Somebody else could steal that message and use it to
                    send the message, "Yo! Take your wallet to the dark alley
                    behind East Hastings at 11PM tomorrow."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Which would be bad.

                    Using a HMAC protects against this attack, 
                    and a few other varieties of attack - it's a
                    good way to generate a signature 
                    for a message.

                    But it doesn't solve all of our problems.
                    People can still snoop on our traffic.
                    <p>
                    With no timestamp, people can still replay 
                    our messages to the server
                    with impunity...

                    <p>
                    So the lesson, here, is that you also shouldn't
                    be using HMAC, really, for this problem.

                    What we want is encryption, so what we need here 
                    is a full-blown encryption algorithm, like RSA, 
                    or a full-blown encryption protocol, like GPG.

                    The take-home message, though, is that you really,

                    shouldn't try to build your own encryption protocol 
                    from scratch out of hash functions.
