                        So my friend would prefer to prototype games in his spare time,
                        and only devote company resources to developing them, once they have
                        a really good prototype.

                        I took it upon myself to suggest some video game ideas that would
                        never, ever work, like "Breakout, but you play as the bricks"

                        Because we were surrounded by software developers, someone quickly
                        volunteered the services of an Indie Game Idea Generator, 
                        which produced incredible ideas like:

                        These ideas, too, were obviously much too good. I would play
                        any of the games that it had described.

                        But, eventually, it came to an idea so bad that nobody could
                        ever want to play it.

                        The reason that this is important, is that Canvas's origin

                        When figuring out how to draw horses, the first thing I tried 
                        was just to draw a circle under the 
                        pen every time I detected a mouse-move while the user was
                        also left-clicking.

                        The perhaps obvious problem with that is that the mouse can move
                        much faster than the sample rate of the browser, so instead of getting
                        smooth flowing lines, we just get dots everywhere.

                        This works pretty well, but fast movements will still result

                        The only difference between a cubic bezier and a quadratic bezier
                        is that the cubic bezier curve has one more control point.

                        The cubic curve is more flexible and can be used to draw more shapes.

                        One thing I talked about a bit earlier was dynamically 
                        setting the cursor property when I was making horse stamps.
                        </p>

                        You can use the CSS 'cursor' property to set the user's
                        cursor to any image that's smaller than 128x128px.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For horse stamps, I would just set the CSS cursor to be
                        the same image as the stamp that was being stamped.
                        </p>

                        While the user was horse-drawing, though, I built a little

                        At the VanJS presentation, I had just attended a talk on Twitter's Flight, an
                        componentiating event-driven framework.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Flight looked interesting, and the concept of building my application
                        as a collection of components that send and receive events really 
                        appealed to me.

                        <p>
                        But for whatever reason, Flight itself wasn't the right framework for me.

                        The reason was that months earlier, I had attended a talk on LucidJS, which
                        is pretty much the same thing, but I was paying WAY more attention during
                        the LucidJS presentation.

                        Javascript also has its own baked in event system, but I feel like it's
                        important to maintain a separation between UI events like 'click' and 
                        application events like 'clear canvas'.

                        <p>
                        We can create an emitter to manage events.
                        </p>

                        Then we can bind a function to an event.

                        <p>
                        Here, we're binding a function to the "superAwesome"
                        event.

                        <p>
                        Then we can call the function by emitting the
                        superAwesome event, passing any arguments we
                        want to pass to the funciton.

                        LucidJS has a lot of features that are above and beyond
                        a standard event emitter -

                        You can have multiple emitters that selectively pipe
                        specific events to one another.

                        You can namespace events, so that only specific listeners
                        will receive those events.

                        can be bound against an event.

                        the component that manages the canvas element -  
                        could bind a function to the "change color" event -

                        at the same time, 
                        the component that manages the cursor
                        could also bind to that event, and change
                        the color of the cursor when it receives
                        the change color event.

                        <p>
                        both of these components are responding separately
                        to the change color event
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        and neither of these components needs to know
                        about the other, or what the other 
                        component is doing with its event

                        The other benefit of an event stream is that
                        the events themselves become a stream of objects
                        that you can manage.

                        <p>
                        It's possible to serialize all events and store them
                        for later, keeping a complete history of every 
                        action taken in your application.

                        Or you could have a component that just listens 
                        for events that change the application's state
                        and uses that to keep track of the application's
                        state using LocalStorage.

                        That same component could emit those events
                        again when the application boots up.

                        Now, if that sounds like a needlessly convoluted
                        way to handle serialization and local storage
                        in your application
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I can assure you that it is
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        because that's how HorseDrawingTycoon stores data

                    <div>
                        <p>If I were to rewrite the serialization of 
                            HorseDrawingTycoon, 
                            I would probably not do it that way. It's
                            quite a bit more complicated than I needed
                            to make it.
